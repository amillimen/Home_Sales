Module 22 Challenge Results

This is the respository for the module 22 challenge results for Amy Millimen-Tola.  It was created independently, with the video created by Dr. A in the master video list.  

If you are reading this, Dr. A, I really enjoyed this bootcamp.  Don't get me wrong, it was draining, and I had to sacrifice all of my personal time and time with my kids to get through it.  But it was a professional and personal goal for me to learn to code in pyhtont to improve my data analysis value/skills, and I can say with 100% confidence, that I have achieved that goal, under your guidance.  

Best of Luck to you, Dr. A and the entire staff at Edx/2U.
